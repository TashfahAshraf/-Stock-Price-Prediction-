#📌 Task Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship.
The task was to predict future stock prices based on historical stock data using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

We were provided with a dataset containing features such as:

-Open Price
-High Price
-Low Price
-Closing Price
-Trading Volume

The objective was to build models that can learn from this historical data and predict the next-day closing price.

###🔧 Steps Performed

###1. Data Preprocessing

-Loaded stock price dataset (from Kaggle).
-Converted Date to datetime format and sorted chronologically.
-Cleaned Volume (converted to numeric, removed missing values).
-Filtered data for a single stock (AAPL).
-Created Target column (Close_t+1) = next day’s closing price.
-Train-test split (80% train, 20% test) using time-based split.

###2. Baseline Model: Linear Regression

-Used features Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
-Predicted Close_t+1.
-Evaluated using:
-Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
-Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
-R² Score
-Visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices.

###3. Advanced Model: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

-Scaled features with MinMaxScaler.
-Created time sequences (lookback = 60 days).
-Built LSTM model with:
-2 LSTM layers
-Dropout for regularization
-Dense output layer
-Trained with EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting.
-Predicted next-day closing prices.
-Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, R².
-Visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices (LSTM).

###4. Naïve Baseline

-Predicted tomorrow’s Close = today’s Close.
-Served as a benchmark to compare ML/DL models.

###5. Model Comparison

###📊 Results & Conclusion 

-Linear Regression performed better than the naive baseline, showing ML can capture basic trends.
-LSTM outperformed Linear Regression, achieving the lowest errors, because it captures temporal dependencies in stock data.
-This demonstrates that deep learning (LSTM) is more suitable for stock price forecasting tasks compared to simple regression.

###🛠 Tech Stack
